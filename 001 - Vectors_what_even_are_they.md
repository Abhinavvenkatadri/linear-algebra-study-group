# Vectors, what even are they?

## Meaning of Vector
* Viewpoints of various domian of study. 
    * for Physicist (arrows pointing in space)
    * CS Student (ordered list of numbers, sets) 
    * Mathematician (Generalizes both the ideas together).

* In Linear Algebra the Vector will almost always origin at 0,0 in Space. And the root of it will always be fixed which is different compared to the way Physics students define vectors.

*  Vectors are coordinates as to how much distance along the X-axis or Y axis , that can also be represented in form of a 1X2 Matrix

## Addition
* the process of finding one vector that is equivalent to the result of the successive application of two or more given vectors. (OR in simple words) To add vectors, lay the first one on a set of axes with its tail at the origin. Place the next vector with its tail at the previous vector's head. When there are no more vectors, draw a straight line from the origin to the head of the last vector. This line is the sum of the vectors.



## Scaling
* Multiplication of a vector by a scalar changes the magnitude of the vector, but leaves its direction unchanged. The scalar changes the size of the vector. The scalar "scales" the vector.
