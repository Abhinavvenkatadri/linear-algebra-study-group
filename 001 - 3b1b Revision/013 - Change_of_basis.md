In linear algebra, a basis for a vector space is a linearly independent set spanning the vector space.

Geometrically the matrix represents transformation from other grid to our grid, but numerically it is exactly opposite.

Inverse of Matrix represents the reverse linear transformation. So the Inverse matrix will be the transformation that will transform the vector from our grid to the other grids.

Translationg matrices is not same as transforming vectors. The following pictures show the various steps in translating a matrix from one coordinate system to another.
