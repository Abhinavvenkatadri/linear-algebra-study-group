# Cross products in the light of linear transformations 

The **Cross product** a Ã— b is defined as a vector c that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to both a and b, with a direction given by the right-hand rule and a magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram that the vectors span

The linear transformation to the number line can be matched to a vector which is called the dual vector of that transformation, such that performing the linear transformation is same as taking the dot product with that vector.
