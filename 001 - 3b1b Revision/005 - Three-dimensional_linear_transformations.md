# Three-dimensional linear transformations

All the concepts of 2-D matrix transformation are followed by the 3-D matrix transformation as well. The only difference being that earlier we were working with 4 numbers in a matrix whereas now we will work on 9 numbers in matrix 

Each of the 3 columns represents the landing position of i,j and k basis vectors respectively.
