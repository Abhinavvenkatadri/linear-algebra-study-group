# Linear transformations and matrices

**Linear Transformation** :Linear (all lines must remain straight and Origin remains fixed )+ Transformation (a function that takes an input and gives an output, the transformation is used instead of function to bring int the role of moment of vector from its initial position to final position ) in easier words parallel and evenly spaced.

Now since we need to think about a lot of vectors and their transformation at a time, it is always better to visualize them as points in space.

* A2-D linear transformation depends on only 4 numbers.
    * 2 cordinates where the i lands.
    * 2 cordinates where the j lands.

These four numbers can be represented in the matrix form as follows:

Here each column represents the point where the i and j vector lands after transformation.
